    an update where pausing during a song DISABLES scoring to make things fair

  - 'The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where
    it isn''t. By subtracting where it is from where it isn''t, or where it isn''t
    from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference or deviation.
    The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive
    the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn''t, and arriving
    at a position where it wasn''t, it now is. Consequently, the position where it
    is, is now the position that it wasn''t, and it follows that the position where
    it was, is now the position that it isn''t. In the event that the position that
    it is in is not the position that it wasn''t, the system has acquired a variation.
    The variation being the difference between where the missile is and where it
    wasn''t. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be
    corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile
    guidance computer scenario works as follows: because a variation has modified
    some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it
    is. However, it is sure where it isn''t, within reason, and it knows where it
    was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn''t, or vice versa,
    and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn''t be,
    and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation, and its variation, which
    is called air.'
